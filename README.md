# Gene-Duplication-Origin-in-a-Non-Model-Organism
UNH Honors Senior Thesis

  Amphibian genomes are notoriously difficult to assemble because of their extremely large size and repetitive content. For this project, I will examine the origin of the repetitive content found in these genomes using the non-model organism, the poison frog Ranitomeya imitator. This study is important because it can help to resolve either the evolutionary history of these bloated genomes or serve to highlight whether the duplicate content found arises from inaccuracies related to the inability of the genome assembly software to process the non-model genomes.
  
  I will take a draft Ranitomeya imitator genome, locate the duplicates and align them to each other, checking for matches that could have arisen from systematic error. I will then systematically compare the duplicates to a database of known genes to classify these repeats.
  
  My work not only will lend itself my undergraduate thesis, but will help inform a project researchers are currently working on that aims to identify the genetic mechanisms of toxin acquisition and variable colors and patterns in poison frogs. My project will look into a specific aspect of the dataset in hopes of resolving critical and biologically relevant questions that the answers to, will dramatically improve the overall final product of the larger poison frog project.
